Implement a simplified version of Twitter which allows users to post tweets, follow/unfollow each other, and view the `10` most recent tweets within their own news feed.

Users and tweets are uniquely identified by their IDs (integers).

Implement the following methods:

* `Twitter()` Initializes the twitter object.
* `void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId)` Publish a new tweet with ID `tweetId` by the user `userId`. You may assume that each `tweetId` is unique.
* `List<Integer> getNewsFeed(int userId)` Fetches at most the `10` most recent tweet IDs in the user's news feed. Each item must be posted by users who the user is following or by the user themself. Tweets IDs should be **ordered from most recent to least recent**.
* `void follow(int followerId, int followeeId)` The user with ID `followerId` follows the user with ID `followeeId`.
* `void unfollow(int followerId, int followeeId)` The user with ID `followerId` unfollows the user with ID `followeeId`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input:
["Twitter", "postTweet", [1, 10], "postTweet", [2, 20], "getNewsFeed", [1], "getNewsFeed", [2], "follow", [1, 2], "getNewsFeed", [1], "getNewsFeed", [2], "unfollow", [1, 2], "getNewsFeed", [1]]

Output:
[null, null, null, [10], [20], null, [20, 10], [20], null, [10]]

Explanation:
Twitter twitter = new Twitter();
twitter.postTweet(1, 10); // User 1 posts a new tweet with id = 10.
twitter.postTweet(2, 20); // User 2 posts a new tweet with id = 20.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);   // User 1's news feed should only contain their own tweets -> [10].
twitter.getNewsFeed(2);   // User 2's news feed should only contain their own tweets -> [20].
twitter.follow(1, 2);     // User 1 follows user 2.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);   // User 1's news feed should contain both tweets from user 1 and user 2 -> [20, 10].
twitter.getNewsFeed(2);   // User 2's news feed should still only contain their own tweets -> [20].
twitter.unfollow(1, 2);   // User 1 unfollows user 2.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);   // User 1's news feed should only contain their own tweets -> [10].
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= userId, followerId, followeeId <= 500`
* `0 <= tweetId <= 10^4`
* All the tweets have **unique** IDs.
* At most `3 * 10^4` calls will be made to `postTweet`, `getNewsFeed`, `follow`, and `unfollow`.
