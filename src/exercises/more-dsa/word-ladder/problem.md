You are given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and also a list of words `wordList`. All of the given words are of the same length, consisting of lowercase English letters, and are all distinct.

Your goal is to transform `beginWord` into `endWord` by following the rules:
    
* You may transform `beginWord` to any word within `wordList`, provided that at exactly one position the words have a different character, and the rest of the positions have the same characters.
* You may repeat the previous step with the new word that you obtain, and you may do this as many times as needed.

Return the **minimum number of words within the transformation sequence** needed to obtain the `endWord`, or `0` if no such sequence exists.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: beginWord = "cat", endWord = "sag", wordList = ["bat","bag","sag","dag","dot"]

Output: 4
```

Explanation: The transformation sequence is `"cat" -> "bat" -> "bag" -> "sag"`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: beginWord = "cat", endWord = "sag", wordList = ["bat","bag","sat","dag","dot"]

Output: 0
```

Explanation: There is no possible transformation sequence from `"cat"` to `"sag"` since the word `"sag"` is not in the wordList.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
* `1 <= wordList.length <= 100`
