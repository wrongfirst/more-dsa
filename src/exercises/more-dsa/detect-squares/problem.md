You are given a stream of points consisting of x-y coordinates on a 2-D plane. Points can be added and queried as follows:

* **Add** - new points can be added to the stream into a data structure. Duplicate points are allowed and should be treated as separate points.
* **Query** - Given a single query point, **count** the number of ways to choose three additional points from the data structure such that the three points and the query point form a **square**. The square must have all sides parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, i.e. no diagonal squares are allowed. Recall that a **square** must have four equal sides.


Implement the `CountSquares` class:
* `CountSquares()` Initializes the object.
* `void add(int[] point)` Adds a new point `point = [x, y]`.
* `int count(int[] point)` Counts the number of ways to form valid **squares** with point `point = [x, y]` as described above.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: 
["CountSquares", "add", [[1, 1]], "add", [[2, 2]], "add", [[1, 2]], "count", [[2, 1]], "count", [[3, 3]], "add", [[2, 2]], "count", [[2, 1]]]
       
Output:
[null, null, null, null, 1, 0, null, 2]

Explanation:
CountSquares countSquares = new CountSquares();
countSquares.add([1, 1]);
countSquares.add([2, 2]);
countSquares.add([1, 2]);

countSquares.count([2, 1]);   // return 1.
countSquares.count([3, 3]);   // return 0.
countSquares.add([2, 2]);     // Duplicate points are allowed.
countSquares.count([2, 1]);   // return 2. 
```

**Constraints:**
* `point.length == 2`
* `0 <= x, y <= 1000`
