The **diameter** of a binary tree is defined as the **length** of the longest path between *any two nodes within the tree*. The path does not necessarily have to pass through the root.
    
The **length** of a path between two nodes in a binary tree is the number of edges between the nodes. Note that the path can *not* include the same node twice.

Given the root of a binary tree `root`, return the **diameter** of the tree.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5]

Output: 3
```

Explanation: 3 is the length of the path `[1,2,3,5]` or `[5,3,2,4]`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: root = [1,2,3]

Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100`
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
