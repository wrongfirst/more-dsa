You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations (e.g. 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc) and an integer `amount` representing a target amount of money.

Return the number of distinct combinations that total up to `amount`. If it's impossible to make up the amount, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an unlimited number of each coin and that each value in `coins` is unique.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: amount = 4, coins = [1,2,3]

Output: 4
```

Explanation:
* 1+1+1+1 = 4
* 1+1+2 = 4
* 2+2 = 4
* 1+3 = 4

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: amount = 7, coins = [2,4]

Output: 0
```


**Constraints:**
* `1 <= coins.length <= 100`
* `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
* `0 <= amount <= 5000`
