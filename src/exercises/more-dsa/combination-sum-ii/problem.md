You are given an array of integers `candidates`, which may contain duplicates, and a target integer `target`. Your task is to return a list of all **unique combinations** of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`.

Each element from `candidates` may be chosen **at most once** within a combination. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

You may return the combinations in **any order** and the order of the numbers in each combination can be in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: candidates = [9,2,2,4,6,1,5], target = 8

Output: [
  [1,2,5],
  [2,2,4],
  [2,6]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: candidates = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 7

Output: [
  [1,2,4],
  [2,5],
  [3,4]
]
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= candidates.length <= 100`
* `1 <= candidates[i] <= 50`
* `1 <= target <= 30`
