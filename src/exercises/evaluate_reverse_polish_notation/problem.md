You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents a **valid** arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Return the integer that represents the evaluation of the expression.

* The operands may be integers or the results of other operations.
* The operators include `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
* Assume that division between integers always truncates toward zero.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: tokens = ["1","2","+","3","*","4","-"]

Output: 5

Explanation: ((1 + 2) * 3) - 4 = 5
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= tokens.length <= 1000`.
* tokens[i] is `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or a string representing an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.
