Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:
* `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
* `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
* `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns `""`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input:
["TimeMap", "set", ["alice", "happy", 1], "get", ["alice", 1], "get", ["alice", 2], "set", ["alice", "sad", 3], "get", ["alice", 3]]

Output:
[null, null, "happy", "happy", null, "sad"]

Explanation:
TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
timeMap.set("alice", "happy", 1);  // store the key "alice" and value "happy" along with timestamp = 1.
timeMap.get("alice", 1);           // return "happy"
timeMap.get("alice", 2);           // return "happy", there is no value stored for timestamp 2, thus we return the value at timestamp 1.
timeMap.set("alice", "sad", 3);    // store the key "alice" and value "sad" along with timestamp = 3.
timeMap.get("alice", 3);           // return "sad"
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100`
* `key` and `value` only include lowercase English letters and digits.
* `0 <= timestamp <= 10^7`
* All the timestamps of `set` are strictly increasing.
