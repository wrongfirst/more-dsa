You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`, each consisting of lowercase English letters.

You are allowed to perform three operations on `word1` an unlimited number of times:

* Insert a character at any position
* Delete a character at any position
* Replace a character at any position

Return the minimum number of operations to make `word1` equal `word2`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: word1 = "monkeys", word2 = "money"

Output: 2
```

Explanation:
`monkeys` -> `monkey` (remove `s`)
`monkey` -> `money`  (remove `k`)

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: word1 = "neatcdee", word2 = "neetcode"

Output: 3
```

Explanation:
`neatcdee` -> `neetcdee`  (replace `a` with `e`)
`neetcdee` -> `neetcde`   (remove last `e`)
`neetcde`  -> `neetcode`  (insert `o`)

**Constraints:**
* `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
