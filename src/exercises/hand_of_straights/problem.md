You are given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `ith` card and an integer `groupSize`.
    
You want to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and card values are consecutively increasing by `1`.

Return `true` if it's possible to rearrange the cards in this way, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: hand = [1,2,4,2,3,5,3,4], groupSize = 4

Output: true
```

Explanation: The cards can be rearranged as `[1,2,3,4]` and `[2,3,4,5]`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: hand = [1,2,3,3,4,5,6,7], groupSize = 4

Output: false
```

Explanation: The closest we can get is `[1,2,3,4]` and `[3,5,6,7]`, but the cards in the second group are not consecutive.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= hand.length <= 10000`
* `0 <= hand[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`
