You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`.
    
Return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, or `false` otherwise. That means if a permutation of `s1` exists as a substring of `s2`, then return `true`.

Both strings only contain lowercase letters.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "lecabee"

Output: true
```

Explanation: The substring `"cab"` is a permutation of `"abc"` and is present in `"lecabee"`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "lecaabee"

Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000`
