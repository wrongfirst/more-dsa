You are given an array of CPU  tasks `tasks`, where `tasks[i]` is an uppercase english character from `A` to `Z`. You are also given an integer `n`. 
    
Each CPU cycle allows the completion of a single task, and tasks may be completed in any order.

The only constraint is that **identical** tasks must be separated by at least `n` CPU cycles, to cooldown the CPU.

Return the *minimum number* of CPU cycles required to complete all tasks.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: tasks = ["X","X","Y","Y"], n = 2

Output: 5
```

Explanation: A possible sequence is: X -> Y -> idle -> X -> Y.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","C"], n = 3

Output: 9
```

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> Idle -> A -> Idle -> Idle -> Idle -> A.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= tasks.length <= 10000`
* `0 <= n <= 100`
