There are `n` gas stations along a circular route. You are given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost` where:

* `gas[i]` is the amount of gas at the `ith` station.
* `cost[i]` is the amount of gas needed to travel from the `ith` station to the `(i + 1)th` station. (The last station is connected to the first station)

You have a car that can store an unlimited amount of gas, but you begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index such that you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction. If it's impossible, then return `-1`.

It's guaranteed that at most one solution exists.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4], cost = [2,2,4,1]

Output: 3
```

Explanation: Start at station 3 and fill up with `gas[3] = 4`, so tank = 4.
Travel from station 3 to station 0, spending `cost[3] = 1`, then fill `gas[0] = 1`, so tank = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4.
Travel from station 0 to station 1, spending `cost[0] = 2`, then fill `gas[1] = 2`, so tank = 4 - 2 + 2 = 4.
Travel from station 1 to station 2, spending `cost[1] = 2`, then fill `gas[2] = 3`, so tank = 4 - 2 + 3 = 5.
Travel from station 2 back to station 3, spending `cost[2] = 4`, so tank = 5 - 4 = 1.
The circuit is complete, so return 3.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: gas = [1,2,3], cost = [2,3,2]

Output: -1
```

Explanation:
You cannot start at station 0 or 1 because neither has enough gas to travel to the next station.
If you start at station 2, fill `gas[2] = 3`, so tank = 3.
Travel from station 2 to station 0, spending `cost[2] = 2`, then fill `gas[0] = 1`, so tank = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
Travel from station 0 to station 1, spending `cost[0] = 2`, then fill `gas[1] = 2`, so tank = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2.
To travel from station 1 to station 2, you need `cost[1] = 3` gas, but the tank only has 2.
So no starting station can complete the circuit, and the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= gas.length == cost.length <= 100000`
* `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 1000`
