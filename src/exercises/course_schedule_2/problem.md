You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` indicates that you **must** take course `b` first if you want to take course `a`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you are required to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. 

Return a valid ordering of courses you can take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it's not possible to finish all courses, return an **empty array**.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,0]]

Output: [0,1,2]
```

Explanation: We must ensure that course 0 is taken before course 1.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]]

Output: []
```

Explanation: It's impossible to finish all courses.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= numCourses <= 1000`
* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 1000`
* All `prerequisite` pairs are **unique**.
