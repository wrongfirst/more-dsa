You are given an array of integers `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of taking a step from the `ith` floor of a staircase. After paying the cost, you can step to either the `(i + 1)th` floor or the `(i + 2)th` floor.

You may choose to start at the index `0` or the index `1` floor.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase, i.e. just past the last index in `cost`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: cost = [1,2,3]

Output: 2
```

Explanation: We can start at index = `1` and pay the cost of `cost[1] = 2` and take two steps to reach the top. The total cost is `2`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: cost = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1]

Output: 4
```

Explanation: Start at index = `0`.
* Pay the cost of `cost[0] = 1` and take two steps to reach index = `2`.
* Pay the cost of `cost[2] = 1` and take two steps to reach index = `4`.
* Pay the cost of `cost[4] = 1` and take two steps to reach index = `6`.
* Pay the cost of `cost[6] = 1` and take one step to reach the top.
* The total cost is `4`.

**Constraints:**
* `2 <= cost.length <= 100`
* `0 <= cost[i] <= 100`
