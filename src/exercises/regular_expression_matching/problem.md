You are given an input string `s` consisting of lowercase english letters, and a pattern `p` consisting of lowercase english letters, as well as `'.'`, and `'*'` characters.

Return `true` if the pattern matches the **entire** input string, otherwise return `false`.

* `'.'` Matches any single character
* `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "aa", p = ".b"

Output: false
```

Explanation: Regardless of which character we choose for the `'.'` in the pattern, we cannot match the second character in the input string.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "nnn", p = "n*"

Output: true
```

Explanation: `'*'` means zero or more of the preceding element, `'n'`. We choose `'n'` to repeat three times.

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: s = "xyz", p = ".*z"

Output: true
```

Explanation: The pattern `".*"` means zero or more of any character, so we choose `".."` to match `"xy"` and `"z"` to match `"z"`.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= s.length <= 20`
* `1 <= p.length <= 20`
* Each appearance of `'*'`, will be preceded by a valid character or `'.'`.
