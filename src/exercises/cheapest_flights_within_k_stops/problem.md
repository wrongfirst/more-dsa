There are `n` airports, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, which are connected by some flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [from_i, to_i, price_i]` represents a one-way flight from airport `from_i` to airport `to_i` with cost `price_i`. You may assume there are no duplicate flights and no flights from an airport to itself.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k` where:

* `src` is the starting airport
* `dst` is the destination airport
* `src != dst`
* `k` is the maximum number of stops you can make (not including `src` and `dst`)

Return **the cheapest price** from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops, or return `-1` if it is impossible.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,200],[1,2,100],[1,3,300],[2,3,100]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1

Output: 500
```

Explanation:
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from airport 0 to 3 is shown in red, with total cost `200 + 300 = 500`.
Note that the path `[0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3]` costs only 400, and thus is cheaper, but it requires 2 stops, which is more than k.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: n = 3, flights = [[1,0,100],[1,2,200],[0,2,100]], src = 1, dst = 2, k = 1

Output: 200
```

Explanation:
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from airport 1 to 2 is shown in red and has cost `200`.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `fromi != toi`
* `1 <= pricei <= 1000`
* `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
