You are given two strings `s` and `t`, both consisting of english letters.
    
Return the number of distinct **subsequences** of `s` which are equal to `t`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "caaat", t = "cat"

Output: 3
```

Explanation: There are 3 ways you can generate `"cat"` from `s`.
* (c)aa(at)
* (c)a(a)a(t)
* (ca)aa(t)

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "xxyxy", t = "xy"

Output: 5
```

Explanation: There are 5 ways you can generate `"xy"` from `s`.
* (x)x(y)xy
* (x)xyx(y)
* x(x)(y)xy
* x(x)yx(y)
* xxy(x)(y)


**Constraints:**
* `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
* `s` and `t` consist of English letters.
