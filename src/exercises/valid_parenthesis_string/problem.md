You are given a string `s` which contains only three types of characters: `'('`, `')'` and `'*'`.

Return `true` if `s` is **valid**, otherwise return `false`.

A string is valid if it follows all of the following rules:

* Every left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
* Every right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
* Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
* A `'*'` could be treated as a right parenthesis `')'` character or a left parenthesis `'('` character, or as an empty string `""`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "((**)"

Output: true
```

Explanation: One of the `'*'` could be a `')'` and the other could be an empty string.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "(((*)"

Output: false
```

Explanation: The string is not valid because there is an extra `'('` at the beginning, regardless of the extra `'*'`.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
