You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the weight of the `ith` stone.

We want to run a simulation on the stones as follows:

* At each step we choose the **two heaviest stones**, with weight `x` and `y` and smash them togethers
* If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed
* If `x < y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

Continue the simulation until there is no more than one stone remaining.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone or return `0` if none remain.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: stones = [2,3,6,2,4]

Output: 1
```
Explanation:
We smash 6 and 4 and are left with a 2, so the array becomes [2,3,2,2].
We smash 3 and 2 and are left with a 1, so the array becomes [1,2,2].
We smash 2 and 2, so the array becomes [1].

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: stones = [1,2]

Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= stones.length <= 20`
* `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`
