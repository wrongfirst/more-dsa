You are given the head of a linked list of length `n`. Unlike a singly linked list, each node contains an additional pointer `random`, which may point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Create a **deep copy** of the list. 

The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **new** nodes, each including:
* The original value `val` of the copied node
* A `next` pointer to the new node corresponding to the `next` pointer of the original node
* A `random` pointer to the new node corresponding to the `random` pointer of the original node

Note: None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

*Return the head of the copied linked list.*

In the examples, the linked list is represented as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where `random_index` is the index of the node (0-indexed) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: head = [[3,null],[7,3],[4,0],[5,1]]

Output: [[3,null],[7,3],[4,0],[5,1]]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: head = [[1,null],[2,2],[3,2]]

Output: [[1,null],[2,2],[3,2]]
```

**Constraints:**
* `0 <= n <= 100`
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* Node values are not guaranteed to be unique.
* `random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.
